Step one: Chose task to do.
The program will prompt you what task you would like to do.
It will ask you to input 1 for inputting data, 2 to search for data or 3 to run a report.

Step 2 option 1: 
If you inputted a 1, you will be present with a prompt to input a date.
This prompt is followed by another one that asks for start time.
The program continues to prompt you for end time, tag, and task name. 
Once all data has been inputted, the program will inform you if your data was saved. 
If data rules are not followed, the program will prompt you and notify you that the input was invalid. 

Step 2 option 2:
If you input a 2, you will be present with a prompt to input a number that corresponds with an option, like before.
The options and numbers are as follows:

Enter 1 to search for tasks on a date
Enter 2 to search for tasks that start at a certain time
Enter 3 to search for tasks that end at a certain time
Enter 4 to search for tasks with a certain name
Enter 5 to search for tasks with a certain tag
Enter 6 to search for tasks with a certain start and end time


If you input 1 - 6, you will be prompted to input a value to search for and every task that matches that value will be outputted.
If data rules are not followed, the program will prompt you and notify you that the input was invalid.

Step 2 option 3: 
If you input a 2, you will be present with a prompt to input a number that corresponds with an option, like before.
The options and numbers are as follows:

Enter 1 to run a Date Range report to see what task have been complete between two dates
Enter 2 to run a Time Consumption report to see what task have the most time spent on them

If you input 1, you will be prompted for 2 dates and all task between those dates will be outputted.
If you input 2, a report detailing how much time was spent as task with the same tag will be outputted.
If data rules are not followed, the program will prompt you and notify you that the input was invalid.
