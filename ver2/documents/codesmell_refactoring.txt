First Round:
Code smell: if-else block from line 37 to 65 and 4 to 29.
Refactoring: Use a state that will provide different functions to users when selected.

Code smell: switch statement from line 77 to 123.
Refactoring: Use a strategy that will switch the algorithm when prompted.

Code smell: Duplicate code from lines 37 to 137.
Refactoring: Extract duplicate code into classes.

Second Round:
Date: Nov 13th
Code smell: if-else in UserHandler lines 22-25, InputVerifier 15-35, Search_handler 23-111.
Refactoring: Use a strategy with a dictionary.

Code smell: Duplicate code in Search_handler lines 30-93.
Refactoring: Extract method.

Third Round:
Date: Nov 14th
Code smell: SRP violation in InputHandler, SearchHandler, and main using SQL methods.
Refactoring: Extract DB class to handle DB operations.

Fourth Round:
Date: Nov 29th
Code smell: SRP violation in SearchHandler and StoreDataHandler working with the DB and handling user output.
Refactoring: Extract user output handling logic and move it into UserHandler.

Code smell: Lazy method in UserHandler lines 22-30.
Refactoring: Move the method body to the calling method.

Code smell: Improper use of inheritance; UserHandler and SearchHandler should inherit from InputHandler (duplicate code).
Refactoring: Make UserHandler a subclass of InputHandler, and InputHandler has InputVerifier.

Code smell: Improper use of aggregation involving InputVerifier and DBHandler being aggregated into a subclass instead of the superclass (duplicate code).
Refactoring: Use InputVerifier and DBHandler in the superclass instead of the subclasses.

Code smell: UserHandler has a long parameter list.
Refactoring: Move duplicate objects to the superclass.

Code smell: Uses of flag values in StoreDataHandler lines 33-36.
Refactoring: Replace the flag with a variable with a meaningful name.

Code smell: Class explosion from reports in the search strategy.
Refactoring: Extract the report feature into its own strategy.

Code smell: Uses of flag values in InputVerifier lines 21-48.
Refactoring: Replace the flag with a variable with a meaningful name.

Code smell: SRP violation; InputVerifier checks input and prints output.
Refactoring: Extract output logic and move it to calling classes.
